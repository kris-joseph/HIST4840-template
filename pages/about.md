## Description

This is a brief description of the podcast episode - perhaps an introduction, teaser, or abstract.

## Transcript

Chelsea: Can you begin with introducing yourself and your association to the St. Lawrence Hall?

Chris: (0:06) Yeah, so I'm Chris Bateman. I'm the manager of the plaques program at Heritage Toronto. And Heritage Toronto is a tenant in St. Lawrence Hall.
We've been in this building, I believe, about a decade now. So I think we're one of the longest running heritage organizations to be in here. And really, my connection to this space is just having worked in it every day for a decade, at least up until the pandemic. (0:33)
And I'm here twice a week. So I know the space quite well. I wrote the plaque outside that talks about some of the history.
(0:42) So I've had a chance to do a dive into that myself. And I don't know, my interest as a historian has come across this building as well. So I wrote a piece for spacing a few years ago now, just sort of trying to get to the bottom of my own curiosity about what this building is and all the different things that have happened in it.

Chelsea: (1:03) Very cool. I know we talked about this earlier. But would you say that the St. Lawrence Hall continues to serve community needs? And how so?

Chris: (1:10) Yeah, not really. -- So the building originally was built very much with community in mind. It was basically the main gathering space for the city in the 1850s. (1:24) There wasn't a public venue of that size available up until that point.
There was churches and things like that that could accommodate a lot of people. But there was no sort of secular meeting spaces for like Massey Halls, for all of that. So the intent of this building is to serve a public function and to serve the community.
(1:45) That's why it exists. But really, the last five years have not been great for St. Lawrence Hall. The building itself is coming to the end of a restoration lifecycle, I suppose.
It was restored most recently in the 1960s. (2:05) It was a centennial project to bring this building up to what was, at the time, perfect condition. And really since then, like any building, it's shown its age.
People have used it. The fixtures are worn out. And I would say probably just before the pandemic, I think the city made the decision to stop promoting it as a space that could be booked.
Up until that point, people got married in the hall a lot. (2:32) Parties, all sorts of things would be happening. But that really hasn't happened for a few years.
I'm sure the pandemic was a factor in that as well. But there is a plan to bring it back at some point in the future, really following on from the North Market once that's finished. There is a plan to make this a public space once again.
(2:53) But really right now, it's kind of languishing, unfortunately. It's a beautiful space. And I get the sense that it's been disused for so long that most people don't actually know it's even here.
When I tell people where I work, they know the building usually. But most of them aren't even aware that there's actually a hall in the hall.

Chelsea: (3:15) So for the second question, what are some other notable features of the hall and its surrounding area that continue to attract public interest?

Chris: Well, we're in, I guess, what you'd call the old town of Toronto.
(3:29) The St. Lawrence neighborhood contains a lot of heritage buildings, one of the older neighborhoods. People come to this area, I think, for a variety of reasons. There's a lot of built architecture in this neighborhood that attracts people.
We are right opposite St. James Cathedral. We've got the St. Lawrence Market to the south of us. And I mean, I don't believe there's many people coming here just to see St. Lawrence Hall.
But it's really a landmark in this neighborhood, at least on the exterior. People come and take photos of this building. I've seen people outside the St. James Park sketching and drawing it.
I think it still has appeal to people, even if they can't get inside, just from an architectural point of view. Those of you outside are welcome. We can wait for that to be over.

Chelsea: I know. I'm sorry, I'm trying not to talk too much and don't interfere with that.

Chris: No, that's OK.

Chelsea: So in your 2016 article, you described the public clock and the bell located at the top of the building as a vital piece of infrastructure. Could you expand on this?

Chris: Yeah. Actually, this is maybe my favorite thing about this building and clocks in general.
So the building was designed in 1850 to have a four-sided public clock, which obviously was an aesthetic decision. But it actually has a function, or had a function, in the sense that not everybody had a wristwatch, and not everybody had access to a clock. So it's kind of ridiculous to think about it now, but knowing what time it was wasn't really an easy question to answer up until relatively recently.
And a lot of towns and cities had their own time, had something called city time, which is basically based on observations from the sun. So there would be someone in each town, well, large towns. So let's say Toronto, or Kingston, or Montreal.
There was someone whose job it was to observe the positioning of the sun and set a master clock that all the other clocks would be set from. And what this meant was that each city had its own time zone, basically. So because, let's say, you're in Kingston, Ontario, the sun rises slightly sooner in Kingston because it's east of here than it does in Toronto.
It's like under seconds, up to a minute. But you get all these different variations in time. And so on the one hand, there's a need for a public clock just to tell people what the agreed on time of day is that we can all set our home clocks to.
But it's, I think I lost my train of thought.

Chelsea: It's OK. Take your time.
